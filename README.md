This project explores the fascinating intersection of machine learning and human emotion by developing a model to classify emotions from speech signals. Utilizing a diverse dataset annotated with emotional labels and speech features, we employ algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree and KNN classifiers, refined through data preprocessing and feature extraction. Our models demonstrate a promising direction in emotion recognition with applications in enhancing customer service experiences.The project underscores the potential of ML in understanding and responding to human affective states.
